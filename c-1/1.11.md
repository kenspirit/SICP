A function f is defined by the rule that f(n) = n if n<3 and f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3) if n> 3. Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure that computes f by means of an iterative process.

Recursive:

```
(define (f n)
    (if (< n 3)
        n
        (+ (f (- n 1)) 
           (* 2 (f (- n 2)))
           (* 3 (f (- n 3))))))
```

Iterative:

```
(define (f n)
    (define (f-iter a b c n)
        (if (< n 3)
            a
            (f-iter (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (- n 1))))
    (f-iter 2 1 0 n))
```
