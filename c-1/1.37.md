a. An infinite continued fraction is an expression of the form  

`f = N1 / (D1 + (N2 / (D3 + (N3 / (D3 + ...)))))`

As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion with the Ni and the Di all equal to 1 produces 1/φ, where φ is the golden ratio (described in section 1.2.2). One way to approximate an infinite continued fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number of terms. Such a truncation – a so-called k-term finite continued fraction – has the form  

`N1 / (D1 + (N2 / (... + Nk/Dk)))`

Suppose that n and d are procedures of one argument (the term index i) that return the Ni and Di of the terms of the continued fraction. Define a procedure cont-frac such that evaluating (cont-frac n d k) computes the value of the k-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating 1/φ using  

```scheme
(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           k)
```

for successive values of k. How large must you make k in order to get an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?  

b. If your cont-frac procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.


```scheme
; Golden ratio: 1.61803398875

(define (cont-frac n d k)
    (define (recur x)
        (if (> x k)
            0
            (/ (n k) (+ (d k) (recur (+ x 1))))))
    (recur 1))

(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           11)

(define (cont-frac-iter n d k)
    (define (iter x result)
        (newline)
        (display " x: ")
        (display x)
        (display " result: ")
        (display result)
        (if (= x k)
            result
            (iter (+ x 1) (/ (n (- k x)) (+ result (d (- k x)))))))
    (iter 1 1))

(cont-frac-iter (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           11)
```
