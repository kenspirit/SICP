Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value

`(x/y^2 + 2y)/3`

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)


(define (good-enough? guess lastguess)
    (< (/ (abs (-  guess lastguess)) guess) 0.001)
)

(define (cubert x)
    (define (cubert-iter guess lastguess)
        (if (good-enough? guess lastguess)
            guess
            (cubert-iter (improve guess) guess)))
    (define (improve guess)
        (/ (+ (/ x (* guess guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))
    (cubert-iter 1.0 0))
