The accumulate procedure is also known as fold-right, because it combines the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements to the right. There is also a fold-left, which is similar to fold-right, except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
        result
        (iter (op result (car rest))
              (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list '() (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left list '() (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that fold-right and fold-left will produce the same values for any sequence.

**Answer**

```scheme
(define (fold-right op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (fold-right op initial (cdr sequence)))))

(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))      ; 3/2
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))       ; 1 / 6
(fold-right list '() (list 1 2 3)) ; (1 (2 (3 ())))
(fold-left list '() (list 1 2 3))  ; (((() 1) 2) 3)
```

`op` must be position unawareness on the parameters passed in.  Like `+`, `*`.

```scheme
(fold-right * 1 (list 1 2 3))      ; 6
(fold-left * 1 (list 1 2 3))       ; 6
```
