A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor `make-vect` and corresponding selectors `xcor-vect` and `ycor-vect`. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement procedures `add-vect`, `sub-vect`, and `scale-vect` that perform the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:

`(x₁, y₁) + (x₂, y₂) = (x₁ + x₂, y₁ + y₂)`
`(x₁, y₁) - (x₂, y₂) = (x₁ - x₂, y₁ - y₂)`
`s * (x₁, y₁) = (sx₁, sy₁)`

```scheme
(define (make-vect x y)
    (cons x y))

(define (xcor-vect v)
    (car v))

(define (ycor-vect v)
    (cdr v))

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
    (make-vect (+ (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2))
        (+ (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
    (make-vect (- (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2))
        (- (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale-vect v scale)
    (make-vect (* scale (xcor-vect v))
        (* scale (ycor-vect v))))
```
