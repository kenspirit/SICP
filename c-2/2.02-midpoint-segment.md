Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your procedures, you'll need a way to print points:

```scheme
(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(define (make-segment s e)
    (cons s e))

(define (start-segment p)
    (car p))

(define (end-segment p)
    (cdr p))

(define (make-point x y)
    (cons x y))

(define (x-point p)
    (car p))

(define (y-point p)
    (cdr p))

(define (midpoint-segment seg)
    (define (point-average point-at)
        (/ (+ (point-at (start-segment seg)) (point-at (end-segment seg))) 2))
    (make-point (point-average x-point) 
                (point-average y-point)))

(print-point (midpoint-segment (make-segment (make-point 0 0) (make-point 4 6))))
```
