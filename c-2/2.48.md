A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors – the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from exercise 2.46 to define a representation for segments with a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment`.

```scheme
(define (make-segment start end)
    (cons start end))

(define (start-segment seg)
    (car seg))

(define (end-segment seg)
    (cdr seg))
```
