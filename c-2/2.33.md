Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following definitions of some basic list-manipulation operations as accumulations:

```scheme
(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) <??>) nil sequence))
(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons <??> <??>))
(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate <??> 0 sequence))
```

**Answer**

```scheme
(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (accumulate op initial (cdr sequence)))))

(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (cons (p x) y)) '() sequence))

(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons seq2 seq1))

(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (+ y 1)) 0 sequence))
```
